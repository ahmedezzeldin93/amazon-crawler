However, there are some issues that should be brought up.Pros:- Excellent blacks. Provides a very deep black picture.- Vivid colors, but it could be a bit better with its 10 bit panel.- No lightbleed at all.- Native 120Hz refresh rate / Full 24p playback.- Very nice build quality. Extremely thin bezel around the panel.- 4x HDMI 2.0 ports, and each support HDR.- Normal and UltraHD Blu-ray movies look very, very nice.- Very low input lag, which is great for gaming.- Motion handling is very good.- Excellent upscaling, especially from 1080p content.- Cable management on the back is a nice addition.- Personally, I've really liked the remotes Samsung uses, but I can see others not enjoying its simplicity. Voice control works well.- I don't use the stands which are provided, but they're of very high quality.Neutral:- Edge-lit display. Other brands are using full array back lighting at the same price or less.- I've noticed some very slight blooming, but it's only when the screen is black and a white logo/image appears.- The \"One Connect Box\" is kind of annoying. Takes up more space and requires another long cable. It works fine, but I'd rather have all ports on the TV itself.- Mounting the TV on the wall or a TV stand with a bracket can be problematic due to the shape on the rear of the TV. Does not include proper M8 screws, so be sure to measure beforehand. You must use the included standoffs. Be careful and plan ahead if you count on mounting this TV.- Be sure to plug in the power and One Connect Box cables in to the TV before mounting or fitting the TV in to a tight space. Their locations (center-bottom) are nearly impossible to reach if you mount it beforehand.- At this time, the Tizen OS can be quite laggy when navigating.- Moving the \"Game Mode\" setting to \"External Devices,\" rather than \"Picture Settings\" of the past causes a waste of time. On past Samsung TV's, it was quick and easy to switch between picture modes. Though using Voice Control helps in this situation.Cons:- Samsung claims the panel is HDR 1000 compatible (1000+ nits brightness), but in reality, it's less than 500 nits. Therefore, it's best to watch in a dimly lit room or in the dark.- HDR isn't all that great on this panel, mostly due to its subpar wide color gamut.- Very poor gradients are displayed at times, primarily when using Game Mode.- Reflections are quite bad on this set.- Poor viewing angles.- For what you get, picture and feature-wise, it's an expensive TV. Especially when other brands are using superior panels and technology at the same cost or less.- Hope that you don't have to ever deal with Samsung's TV customer support. Long story short: it's the worst support experience I've ever dealt with.Conclusion:Even though the MU8000 provides a very nice overall picture and excellent build quality, there are a couple of areas where Samsung basically used false advertising. If you can find last year's KS8000 series ($1,000 now for the 55\"), then definitely purchase that over the MU8000. It fully supports HDR 1000 and provides a much wider color gamut. The new Sony 900E series is also a much better option, picture-wise, and it's the same price as the MU8000. I simply feel that $1,500 is too much money for what this model claims to provide, but doesn't afterall. However, it is a nice package for the most part."], ["I've had this TV for a couple of months now.  It is awesome,Picture clarity is exceptional.  The darks are extremely dark.Of course, it's best with 4K content (which I can find on Netflix).But even regular HD content looks gorgeous.The SmartHub is very fast; it comes up instantaneously, and the apps load quickly.It comes with everything you may want - Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO and many others for video; Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio and others for music. It even comes with a pretty decent Web browser, I was able to log into the Cliburn competition and watch a lot of it through the browser, with no problems and no latency at all.The built-in speakers are pretty decent, but I had it installed with a Sonos soundbar system.It is big, but not overwhelmingly so - I had it installed above a fireplace, and it fills the space but does not dominate it.  It is very thin for its size, and surprisingly not that heavy (I could lift it myself).Finally, I absolutely LOVE the remote.  It is ergonomics exemplified!  Fits very nicely in hand, has ingeniously simple controls, every button is distinct, with its own feel.  It is really exceptionally well designed.  Bravo to Samsung - it is one of the best electronic products overall I ever used, ever.I only have two complaints about the TV.  One, it does NOT have a plug for headphones.  How can a TV with all these features not have a simple little plug?  I couldn't believe it.  I had to buy a special gizmo (MPOW, which is a GREAT product - I reviewed it separately) to connect my Bose headphones to the Bluetooth output (the only option).  Minor complaint two, sometimes the apps get \"stuck.\"  A couple of times I turned off the TV while Netflix or Amazon was running, and when I turned it back on, it was not responsive to any other buttons on the remote (just on and off). I had to unplug it to \"reboot,\" then it was fine again.

Love the ultra thin profile and the almost invisible bezel maximizing screen in no wasted space.Only knock against this is the weird external wiring from Samsung. Instead of plugging your HDMIs into the TV, they've moved to the \"One Connect\", a proprietary signal cable and hub. So you get an extra device hub you plug all your HDMI/etc into, and that sits with your other multimedia components. It connects to the TV via a generous 6' (I believe) length cord, but again with their proprietary connectors. Bizarrely, this proprietary connector doesn't include power, so you have a second wire coming down out of your tv for your power, with what seems like standard connectors. I have no clue why they went to the trouble to have a special cord and didn't just include the power in it. They should have called it the \"Two Connect\", since you have two cords, not one.Anyway, strangest of all... Samsung made these two wires (the proprietary One Connect and the power cord) LIGHT GRAY in color. I was literally shocked to discover this. Here's this expensive, fancy, ultra-thin TV (perfect for low-profile wall mounting) with black bezel and backing... and GRAY cords that stand out like a sore thumb. I guess maybe so they blend better with a (gray) wall, if you were so inclined as to just run them down the wall exposed instead of hiding them in-wall or inside a conduit?

I originally looked at purchasing a Samsung KS8000 (2016 model) based on reviews but those are super hard to find now. I use rtings.com almost exclusively to compare different models and get the reviews on the major features I am looking for (HDR, wide color gamut, local dimming, and input lag). Based on what I was looking for, pretty much gaming with future potential for 4k Blu Ray, I went with the Sony XBRX900E. So far I am completely happy and satisfied with my choice. First off definitely research online and don't only base your decision from what you see at a local store. I always go into my local Best buy to get a first hand look but you can't know what you are actually getting unless you research online (specs like brightness, HDR, input lag, wide color gamut, etc). This TV is awesome when you have a PS4 pro and are going from no 4K and no HDR to this TV with those features. The games on PS4 pro that have been enhanced look awesome (Horizon XD, Shadow of Mordor, Deus Ex MD, NMD, Titan Fall 2, Ratchet and Clank, etc) night and day difference. No lag, HDR is awesome, colors and brightness make games more immersive. The smart capabilities of this TV are great for streaming 4k content (Amazon and YouTube). I've obviously never streamed 4k before since I didn't have a 4k TV but I find myself streaming random things in 4k just to see the beautiful picture. It's amazing how much random content is available to stream in 4K. I have a Vizio soundbar with a optical input and was concerned that I would have to use two different remotes. In the home screen (press the home button) there is a picture of what I initially thought was a random video labeled \"audio control setup\" it walks you through connecting the included RF blaster\" so you can control your sound bar with the Sony remote, nice. No complaints so far. If you have been looking for a 4K TV to pair with your PS4 pro or to view/stream 4K content this is a great choice.", "Great for PS4 Pro and streaming 4K content", "5.0 out of 5 stars"], ["I\u2019ve had the 75\u201d 4K HDTV for over a month now and overall it is a great set. However, upgrading from a Samsung HD TV, there are some things to note.OVERALL (the short version): I would recommend this TV for the picture quality alone. 5 Stars. It is magnificent! There are workarounds for the CONS listed below, so overall it\u2019s a terrific set for 4K content as well as regular HD content. I\u2019ve decided to start with the CONS to get them out of the way. The PROS follow below.CONS:The SONY BRAVIA 4K XBR75X900E does not seem to be able to handle internet speeds much higher than 60mbps (wired or connected by LAN). This is acceptable for streaming HD on the apps that accompany the set, but 4K content can be iffy. I tried viewing a Coral Reef video on Amazon Prime in 4K, and it took almost a minute for the picture to catch up to 4K quality. There were a few times the picture lagged. I tried watching a random standup comedy video on Netflix in 4K and the server wouldn\u2019t connect. This was probably an issue with Netflix because when I tried again, the connection worked and seemed to hold a 4K picture in a similar way to the Amazon app. The YouTube app was the same. 4K videos lagged and took some time to catch up.Luckily, the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)\u00a0I purchased can handle faster internet speeds, so we use the player almost exclusively for streaming 4K content. I\u2019ve also read other reviewers mention that Chromecast or an\u00a0Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player\u00a0can handle higher internet streaming speeds, so that is something to consider. Also, the TV takes about a minute to connect to Wi-Fi after it\u2019s turned on. Not a big deal, but worth noting. Connected to LAN, it connects a little quicker.Upscaling looks terrible when done on the TV. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to be the issue, but once again, the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)\u00a0saved the day! Upscale regular Blu-Ray\u2019s on the player, and the picture looks nearly as good as actual 4K. You will notice the difference. We streamed a few older shows from HULU like Cheers and Seinfeld and they looked great as well. Again, the picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!**** HDR UPDATE ***I want to thank everyone for their comments about my negative thoughts on HDR. It forced me to do some research on the internet to figure out why HDR looked to terrible on this set. After trial and error, I finally figured it out. You see, I have a home theater system. I bought an ONKYO Receiver a few years back that was 4K compatible. I did not, however, take into consideration that it might not be HDR compatible. (It's not.) So, I was running the 4K player through an HDMI cable into the receiver first, and then into the 4K TV. Which means, no HDR content was reaching the TV. So, as one commenter pointed out, I was turning HDR on when no HDR was available, which results in my original comments below, the picture is dark and the colors look cartoonish.I WAS WRONG!! And I'm glad I was wrong. Nobody likes eating crow, but I am happy to do it after I saw HDR for the first time last night. It is awesome! The colors look amazing, the blacks are really dark, and the whites are really white. My wife and I watched Coral Reef Adventure under the Prime UHD selection from the Amazon app directly on the TV. HDR turned on automatically (as a commenter mentioned it should), and WOW!! It looked spectacular.If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing a bad picture when turning HDR on, they must first realize that not all 4K content is presented with HDR. But what really fixed my situation is this: Run the HDMI directly from the 4K Player to the HDMI \"1\" slot in the back of the TV. That's all it took to make HDR a reality, the way it was intended.I'm keeping the original comments in the review in the hopes of helping anyone else who experiences this issue. Thank you again for the comments about how HDR should work. You guys are the best!***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL COMMENTS*HDR is terrible. This is not the fault of the set, but I want to talk about it here because it\u2019s not worth turning on. If it works for you because of bright lighting in the room or whatever, go for it. But for my wife and I, HDR is not needed. Basically, it\u2019s an artificial layer added to the original picture source to \u201cenhance\u201d things. After several days of tweaking with the settings, trying multiple HDR enabled discs, etc., the picture only got worse with HDR turned on. All it seems to do is make every scene darker, a LOT darker. The HDR effect on colors can be weird. There is a slight red push over flesh tones, and sometimes the colors appear cartoonish, like they were drawn in with crayons. It\u2019s gimmicky, at best. So, if you\u2019re new to 4K, and you\u2019re worried that this set won\u2019t support Dolby Vision, don\u2019t worry too much about it. The 4K picture alone is beautiful you won\u2019t be disappointed with the picture as it is.Also, on the subject of HDR: There are three options, ON, OFF, and AUTO. The only time HDR will turn on is when the HDR setting is switched specifically to ON. If set to AUTO, it might as well be set to OFF because it will never turn on automatically.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************PROS:The picture is beautiful! It is a vast improvement over the regular HD picture from our older TV (which looked great as far as 1080P goes). There are many settings to tweak the set to your liking, and the LIVE FOOTBALL mode is perfect for games. When you watch 4K content, you can get up right next to the screen and see amazing details in the background. You probably don\u2019t want to watch a movie right up close to the screen, but sometimes it\u2019s fun to check out the details of things in the distance.My wife and I have watched Blu-Ray movies and UHD 4K movies from discs as well as streaming 4K content (using the separate 4K player), and they all look great. Regular DVD\u2019s leave a little to be desired, but I knew that going in, so it\u2019s not much of a surprise. What sells this set is the picture! And let\u2019s be honest, this is what you\u2019re looking for in a 75\u201d 4K UHD set. It is spectacular for HD and 4K content! Spectacular!Games and Apps: I play Uncharted 4 on a regular PS4 (not the pro) and the details in color are phenomenal. WOW!! I can\u2019t imagine the game looking any better on a PS4 Pro, but I\u2019d have to do a side by side comparison to really tell the difference.*A NOTE ON SCREEN MIRRORING: If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, it probably will not connect to the TV. The phone will locate the set, but won't connect. SOLUTION: Use Chromecast or (once again) the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)", "The picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!", "5.0 out of 5 stars"], ["Inky black OLED like experience at a fraction of the cost!", "I was bent on getting a 75 inch TV and I really wanted to get OLED; that left the LG TV with a $20,000 price tag. So, next, I was bent on getting a Samsung because I like the brightness of their screens. Samsung is charging $6000 for their 65\" QLED technology which is barely the next generation of technology. Looking at the Rtings website reviews for best 75 inch TVs, they mentioned that the best mid range 75 inch TV was this Sony 75\" X900E. I did the research. It is not OLED in terms of measurable quantities (it is very good) but I will tell you that the actual viewing experience is 99% of what it is with an OLED TV. The blacks are inky wet black and the the brights are amazing. I can watch this TV outside and it looks great. It very bright. The aesthetics are beautiful.

The picture quality, is just amazing and again I can't stress enough how beautiful the HDR (High Dynamic Range) is. Deep rich blacks, plenty of mid tones and excellent highlights. For the price difference I would buy this TV every time and not really miss any real perceivable differences in OLED.

However, there are some issues that should be brought up.Pros:- Excellent blacks. Provides a very deep black picture.- Vivid colors, but it could be a bit better with its 10 bit panel.- No lightbleed at all.- Native 120Hz refresh rate / Full 24p playback.- Very nice build quality. Extremely thin bezel around the panel.- 4x HDMI 2.0 ports, and each support HDR.- Normal and UltraHD Blu-ray movies look very, very nice.- Very low input lag, which is great for gaming.- Motion handling is very good.- Excellent upscaling, especially from 1080p content.- Cable management on the back is a nice addition.- Personally, I've really liked the remotes Samsung uses, but I can see others not enjoying its simplicity. Voice control works well.- I don't use the stands which are provided, but they're of very high quality.Neutral:- Edge-lit display. Other brands are using full array back lighting at the same price or less.- I've noticed some very slight blooming, but it's only when the screen is black and a white logo/image appears.- The \"One Connect Box\" is kind of annoying. Takes up more space and requires another long cable. It works fine, but I'd rather have all ports on the TV itself.- Mounting the TV on the wall or a TV stand with a bracket can be problematic due to the shape on the rear of the TV. Does not include proper M8 screws, so be sure to measure beforehand. You must use the included standoffs. Be careful and plan ahead if you count on mounting this TV.- Be sure to plug in the power and One Connect Box cables in to the TV before mounting or fitting the TV in to a tight space. Their locations (center-bottom) are nearly impossible to reach if you mount it beforehand.- At this time, the Tizen OS can be quite laggy when navigating.- Moving the \"Game Mode\" setting to \"External Devices,\" rather than \"Picture Settings\" of the past causes a waste of time. On past Samsung TV's, it was quick and easy to switch between picture modes. Though using Voice Control helps in this situation.Cons:- Samsung claims the panel is HDR 1000 compatible (1000+ nits brightness), but in reality, it's less than 500 nits. Therefore, it's best to watch in a dimly lit room or in the dark.- HDR isn't all that great on this panel, mostly due to its subpar wide color gamut.- Very poor gradients are displayed at times, primarily when using Game Mode.- Reflections are quite bad on this set.- Poor viewing angles.- For what you get, picture and feature-wise, it's an expensive TV. Especially when other brands are using superior panels and technology at the same cost or less.- Hope that you don't have to ever deal with Samsung's TV customer support. Long story short: it's the worst support experience I've ever dealt with.Conclusion:Even though the MU8000 provides a very nice overall picture and excellent build quality, there are a couple of areas where Samsung basically used false advertising. If you can find last year's KS8000 series ($1,000 now for the 55\"), then definitely purchase that over the MU8000. It fully supports HDR 1000 and provides a much wider color gamut. The new Sony 900E series is also a much better option, picture-wise, and it's the same price as the MU8000. I simply feel that $1,500 is too much money for what this model claims to provide, but doesn't afterall. However, it is a nice package for the most part."], ["I've had this TV for a couple of months now.  It is awesome,Picture clarity is exceptional.

It even comes with a pretty decent Web browser, I was able to log into the Cliburn competition and watch a lot of it through the browser, with no problems and no latency at all.The built-in speakers are pretty decent, but I had it installed with a Sonos soundbar system.It is big, but not overwhelmingly so - I had it installed above a fireplace, and it fills the space but does not dominate it.  It is very thin for its size, and surprisingly not that heavy (I could lift it myself).Finally, I absolutely LOVE the remote.  It is ergonomics exemplified!  Fits very nicely in hand, has ingeniously simple controls, every button is distinct, with its own feel.  It is really exceptionally well designed.  Bravo to Samsung - it is one of the best electronic products overall I ever used, ever.I only have two complaints about the TV.  One, it does NOT have a plug for headphones.  How can a TV with all these features not have a simple little plug?  I couldn't believe it.  I had to buy a special gizmo (MPOW, which is a GREAT product - I reviewed it separately) to connect my Bose headphones to the Bluetooth output (the only option).  Minor complaint two, sometimes the apps get \"stuck.\"  A couple of times I turned off the TV while Netflix or Amazon was running, and when I turned it back on, it was not responsive to any other buttons on the remote (just on and off).

I originally looked at purchasing a Samsung KS8000 (2016 model) based on reviews but those are super hard to find now. I use rtings.com almost exclusively to compare different models and get the reviews on the major features I am looking for (HDR, wide color gamut, local dimming, and input lag). Based on what I was looking for, pretty much gaming with future potential for 4k Blu Ray, I went with the Sony XBRX900E. So far I am completely happy and satisfied with my choice. First off definitely research online and don't only base your decision from what you see at a local store. I always go into my local Best buy to get a first hand look but you can't know what you are actually getting unless you research online (specs like brightness, HDR, input lag, wide color gamut, etc). This TV is awesome when you have a PS4 pro and are going from no 4K and no HDR to this TV with those features. The games on PS4 pro that have been enhanced look awesome (Horizon XD, Shadow of Mordor, Deus Ex MD, NMD, Titan Fall 2, Ratchet and Clank, etc) night and day difference. No lag, HDR is awesome, colors and brightness make games more immersive. The smart capabilities of this TV are great for streaming 4k content (Amazon and YouTube). I've obviously never streamed 4k before since I didn't have a 4k TV but I find myself streaming random things in 4k just to see the beautiful picture. It's amazing how much random content is available to stream in 4K. I have a Vizio soundbar with a optical input and was concerned that I would have to use two different remotes. In the home screen (press the home button) there is a picture of what I initially thought was a random video labeled \"audio control setup\" it walks you through connecting the included RF blaster\" so you can control your sound bar with the Sony remote, nice. No complaints so far. If you have been looking for a 4K TV to pair with your PS4 pro or to view/stream 4K content this is a great choice.", "Great for PS4 Pro and streaming 4K content"], ["5.0", "I\u2019ve had the 75\u201d 4K HDTV for over a month now and overall it is a great set. However, upgrading from a Samsung HD TV, there are some things to note.OVERALL (the short version): I would recommend this TV for the picture quality alone. 5 Stars. It is magnificent! There are workarounds for the CONS listed below, so overall it\u2019s a terrific set for 4K content as well as regular HD content. I\u2019ve decided to start with the CONS to get them out of the way. The PROS follow below.CONS:The SONY BRAVIA 4K XBR75X900E does not seem to be able to handle internet speeds much higher than 60mbps (wired or connected by LAN). This is acceptable for streaming HD on the apps that accompany the set, but 4K content can be iffy. I tried viewing a Coral Reef video on Amazon Prime in 4K, and it took almost a minute for the picture to catch up to 4K quality. There were a few times the picture lagged. I tried watching a random standup comedy video on Netflix in 4K and the server wouldn\u2019t connect. This was probably an issue with Netflix because when I tried again, the connection worked and seemed to hold a 4K picture in a similar way to the Amazon app. The YouTube app was the same. 4K videos lagged and took some time to catch up.Luckily, the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)\u00a0I purchased can handle faster internet speeds, so we use the player almost exclusively for streaming 4K content. I\u2019ve also read other reviewers mention that Chromecast or an\u00a0Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player\u00a0can handle higher internet streaming speeds, so that is something to consider. Also, the TV takes about a minute to connect to Wi-Fi after it\u2019s turned on. Not a big deal, but worth noting. Connected to LAN, it connects a little quicker.Upscaling looks terrible when done on the TV. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to be the issue, but once again, the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)\u00a0saved the day! Upscale regular Blu-Ray\u2019s on the player, and the picture looks nearly as good as actual 4K. You will notice the difference. We streamed a few older shows from HULU like Cheers and Seinfeld and they looked great as well. Again, the picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!**** HDR UPDATE ***I want to thank everyone for their comments about my negative thoughts on HDR. It forced me to do some research on the internet to figure out why HDR looked to terrible on this set. After trial and error, I finally figured it out. You see, I have a home theater system. I bought an ONKYO Receiver a few years back that was 4K compatible. I did not, however, take into consideration that it might not be HDR compatible. (It's not.) So, I was running the 4K player through an HDMI cable into the receiver first, and then into the 4K TV. Which means, no HDR content was reaching the TV. So, as one commenter pointed out, I was turning HDR on when no HDR was available, which results in my original comments below, the picture is dark and the colors look cartoonish.I WAS WRONG!! And I'm glad I was wrong. Nobody likes eating crow, but I am happy to do it after I saw HDR for the first time last night. It is awesome! The colors look amazing, the blacks are really dark, and the whites are really white. My wife and I watched Coral Reef Adventure under the Prime UHD selection from the Amazon app directly on the TV. HDR turned on automatically (as a commenter mentioned it should), and WOW!! It looked spectacular.If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing a bad picture when turning HDR on, they must first realize that not all 4K content is presented with HDR. But what really fixed my situation is this: Run the HDMI directly from the 4K Player to the HDMI \"1\" slot in the back of the TV. That's all it took to make HDR a reality, the way it was intended.I'm keeping the original comments in the review in the hopes of helping anyone else who experiences this issue. Thank you again for the comments about how HDR should work. You guys are the best!***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL COMMENTS*HDR is terrible. This is not the fault of the set, but I want to talk about it here because it\u2019s not worth turning on. If it works for you because of bright lighting in the room or whatever, go for it. But for my wife and I, HDR is not needed. Basically, it\u2019s an artificial layer added to the original picture source to \u201cenhance\u201d things. After several days of tweaking with the settings, trying multiple HDR enabled discs, etc., the picture only got worse with HDR turned on. All it seems to do is make every scene darker, a LOT darker. The HDR effect on colors can be weird. There is a slight red push over flesh tones, and sometimes the colors appear cartoonish, like they were drawn in with crayons. It\u2019s gimmicky, at best. So, if you\u2019re new to 4K, and you\u2019re worried that this set won\u2019t support Dolby Vision, don\u2019t worry too much about it. The 4K picture alone is beautiful you won\u2019t be disappointed with the picture as it is.Also, on the subject of HDR: There are three options, ON, OFF, and AUTO. The only time HDR will turn on is when the HDR setting is switched specifically to ON. If set to AUTO, it might as well be set to OFF because it will never turn on automatically.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************PROS:The picture is beautiful! It is a vast improvement over the regular HD picture from our older TV (which looked great as far as 1080P goes). There are many settings to tweak the set to your liking, and the LIVE FOOTBALL mode is perfect for games. When you watch 4K content, you can get up right next to the screen and see amazing details in the background. You probably don\u2019t want to watch a movie right up close to the screen, but sometimes it\u2019s fun to check out the details of things in the distance.My wife and I have watched Blu-Ray movies and UHD 4K movies from discs as well as streaming 4K content (using the separate 4K player), and they all look great. Regular DVD\u2019s leave a little to be desired, but I knew that going in, so it\u2019s not much of a surprise. What sells this set is the picture! And let\u2019s be honest, this is what you\u2019re looking for in a 75\u201d 4K UHD set. It is spectacular for HD and 4K content! Spectacular!Games and Apps: I play Uncharted 4 on a regular PS4 (not the pro) and the details in color are phenomenal. WOW!! I can\u2019t imagine the game looking any better on a PS4 Pro, but I\u2019d have to do a side by side comparison to really tell the difference.*A NOTE ON SCREEN MIRRORING: If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, it probably will not connect to the TV. The phone will locate the set, but won't connect.

If you can find last year's KS8000 series ($1,000 now for the 55\"), then definitely purchase that over the MU8000. It fully supports HDR 1000 and provides a much wider color gamut. The new Sony 900E series is also a much better option, picture-wise, and it's the same price as the MU8000. I simply feel that $1,500 is too much money for what this model claims to provide, but doesn't afterall. However, it is a nice package for the most part."], ["5.0", "I've had this TV for a couple of months now.  It is awesome,Picture clarity is exceptional.  The darks are extremely dark.Of course, it's best with 4K content (which I can find on Netflix).But even regular HD content looks gorgeous.The SmartHub is very fast; it comes up instantaneously, and the apps load quickly.It comes with everything you may want - Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO and many others for video; Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio and others for music. It even comes with a pretty decent Web browser, I was able to log into the Cliburn competition and watch a lot of it through the browser, with no problems and no latency at all.The built-in speakers are pretty decent, but I had it installed with a Sonos soundbar system.It is big, but not overwhelmingly so - I had it installed above a fireplace, and it fills the space but does not dominate it.  It is very thin for its size, and surprisingly not that heavy (I could lift it myself).Finally, I absolutely LOVE the remote.  It is ergonomics exemplified!  Fits very nicely in hand, has ingeniously simple controls, every button is distinct, with its own feel.  It is really exceptionally well designed.  Bravo to Samsung - it is one of the best electronic products overall I ever used, ever.I only have two complaints about the TV.  One, it does NOT have a plug for headphones.  How can a TV with all these features not have a simple little plug?  I couldn't believe it.  I had to buy a special gizmo (MPOW, which is a GREAT product - I reviewed it separately) to connect my Bose headphones to the Bluetooth output (the only option).  Minor complaint two, sometimes the apps get \"stuck.\"  A couple of times I turned off the TV while Netflix or Amazon was running, and when I turned it back on, it was not responsive to any other buttons on the remote (just on and off). I had to unplug it to \"reboot,\" then it was fine again.  It only happened a couple of times.So overall, I would buy it again, it's just awesome.", "A great TV with a phenomenally good remote."], ["5.0", "Don't listen to the reviews!", "Love this tv, don't listen to all the negative reviews.

I didn\u2019t feel that I had to change the layout.-  Saturated reds, blues, greens are well in their levels and no matter how high the brightness level I make it these primary color still perform beautifully.-  No neutral pixels you\u2019re going to find on this screen.  By connecting my laptop to show off HD screensavers, this TV brought the incredible color detail of each one (an array of colors).-  Yes, 4K is shown in all its glory when you get this.-  Samsung Smarthub layout is pretty easy to master as connecting your Netflix account and even internet browsing is pretty simple to do (I still prefer google chrome since my phone will always be near me).-  HDR is indeed a great experience to see when the lights are turned down.  My HDR experience from Amazon as it\u2019s currently one of the few that can give you the option to see its show under the HDR experience.-  Found it really cool when I turn on my PS4 it immediately switches the display layout to its game mode without me even lifting the remote.-  Playing GTA 5 I didn\u2019t see any lag that\u2019s enough to make a notice about (Beautiful experience when driving a car in GTA.).-  All you need is to download Miracast on your computer and that\u2019s it. I was able to connect to it right away.-  Oneremote controller buttons have a nice push and they don't have any discomforts as you can everything you need if you don\u2019t have your phone, laptop, or your gaming counsel around.-  It's future proof, this is not a 4 year and be done with it.  You will be good for a while.Cons and Oks:__________-  There are hardware glitches upon digging deeper into the system.  Scrolling with the remote does have some notice lag as well as sometimes I have to press an option twice to get a layout to open.  I would assume future updates will fix this issue.-  A decent amount of input layouts to get where you need to go.  It\u2019s a learning curve as it\u2019s something you\u2019re not going to learn in a day.-  Playing HDR content the brightness isn\u2019t the best around.  It\u2019s not bright at all and it\u2019s something to take note if you\u2019re planning to put this in an open floor panel.-  The viewing angles are not good as I notice that the picture quality depletes if you move, from the center to the left and right of the screen.  I would think after 6 feet away from the center you\u2019re going to see a loss in quality (It's really not the much, but something you should know.)-  Pretty expensive given what the market is offering for the same in software quality.-  The brightness issue throughout the television is something to note, this is not only HDR.-  The black levels are good but I\u2019m sorry, OLED TVs excel in this area.-  The remote itself can\u2019t always be reliable as I recommend you use your phone for most of the interaction.Bottom Line:__________Samsung has provided a great design and picture quality for this and it\u2019s indeed future proof.  The color content is spot on and integrated smart TV with 4k is a bundle of joy.  Put it on the wall and it\u2019ll look like a picture while the HDR experience will prepare you for the future of viewing.There are some hiccups that need to be addressed with this design as HDR isn\u2019t much on the market yet and shouldn\u2019t be a must have feature right now (will be in the future).  Software glitches and brightness issues are something to take note when buying this layout.  You will have lag sometimes when using the remote as I try to get the most of my experience with the phone. Not only that but you will find cheaper TV\u2019s with the same layout that this one has.Overall these cons are really not significant to change your mind as the main question you need to ask is whether you prefer OLED instead.  As a Samsung user for many years, each TV made by them will hold its ground well beyond the expected breaking point.  They put great care into making their TV\u2019s and is why the brand is one reason you need to take into account before you buy.

Love the ultra thin profile and the almost invisible bezel maximizing screen in no wasted space.Only knock against this is the weird external wiring from Samsung. Instead of plugging your HDMIs into the TV, they've moved to the \"One Connect\", a proprietary signal cable and hub. So you get an extra device hub you plug all your HDMI/etc into, and that sits with your other multimedia components. It connects to the TV via a generous 6' (I believe) length cord, but again with their proprietary connectors. Bizarrely, this proprietary connector doesn't include power, so you have a second wire coming down out of your tv for your power, with what seems like standard connectors. I have no clue why they went to the trouble to have a special cord and didn't just include the power in it. They should have called it the \"Two Connect\", since you have two cords, not one.Anyway, strangest of all... Samsung made these two wires (the proprietary One Connect and the power cord) LIGHT GRAY in color. I was literally shocked to discover this. Here's this expensive, fancy, ultra-thin TV (perfect for low-profile wall mounting) with black bezel and backing... and GRAY cords that stand out like a sore thumb.

I originally looked at purchasing a Samsung KS8000 (2016 model) based on reviews but those are super hard to find now. I use rtings.com almost exclusively to compare different models and get the reviews on the major features I am looking for (HDR, wide color gamut, local dimming, and input lag). Based on what I was looking for, pretty much gaming with future potential for 4k Blu Ray, I went with the Sony XBRX900E. So far I am completely happy and satisfied with my choice. First off definitely research online and don't only base your decision from what you see at a local store. I always go into my local Best buy to get a first hand look but you can't know what you are actually getting unless you research online (specs like brightness, HDR, input lag, wide color gamut, etc). This TV is awesome when you have a PS4 pro and are going from no 4K and no HDR to this TV with those features. The games on PS4 pro that have been enhanced look awesome (Horizon XD, Shadow of Mordor, Deus Ex MD, NMD, Titan Fall 2, Ratchet and Clank, etc) night and day difference. No lag, HDR is awesome, colors and brightness make games more immersive. The smart capabilities of this TV are great for streaming 4k content (Amazon and YouTube). I've obviously never streamed 4k before since I didn't have a 4k TV but I find myself streaming random things in 4k just to see the beautiful picture. It's amazing how much random content is available to stream in 4K. I have a Vizio soundbar with a optical input and was concerned that I would have to use two different remotes. In the home screen (press the home button) there is a picture of what I initially thought was a random video labeled \"audio control setup\" it walks you through connecting the included RF blaster\" so you can control your sound bar with the Sony remote, nice. No complaints so far. If you have been looking for a 4K TV to pair with your PS4 pro or to view/stream 4K content this is a great choice.", "Great for PS4 Pro and streaming 4K content"], ["5.0", "I\u2019ve had the 75\u201d 4K HDTV for over a month now and overall it is a great set. However, upgrading from a Samsung HD TV, there are some things to note.OVERALL (the short version): I would recommend this TV for the picture quality alone. 5 Stars. It is magnificent! There are workarounds for the CONS listed below, so overall it\u2019s a terrific set for 4K content as well as regular HD content. I\u2019ve decided to start with the CONS to get them out of the way. The PROS follow below.CONS:The SONY BRAVIA 4K XBR75X900E does not seem to be able to handle internet speeds much higher than 60mbps (wired or connected by LAN). This is acceptable for streaming HD on the apps that accompany the set, but 4K content can be iffy. I tried viewing a Coral Reef video on Amazon Prime in 4K, and it took almost a minute for the picture to catch up to 4K quality. There were a few times the picture lagged. I tried watching a random standup comedy video on Netflix in 4K and the server wouldn\u2019t connect. This was probably an issue with Netflix because when I tried again, the connection worked and seemed to hold a 4K picture in a similar way to the Amazon app. The YouTube app was the same. 4K videos lagged and took some time to catch up.Luckily, the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)\u00a0I purchased can handle faster internet speeds, so we use the player almost exclusively for streaming 4K content. I\u2019ve also read other reviewers mention that Chromecast or an\u00a0Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player\u00a0can handle higher internet streaming speeds, so that is something to consider. Also, the TV takes about a minute to connect to Wi-Fi after it\u2019s turned on. Not a big deal, but worth noting. Connected to LAN, it connects a little quicker.Upscaling looks terrible when done on the TV. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to be the issue, but once again, the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)\u00a0saved the day! Upscale regular Blu-Ray\u2019s on the player, and the picture looks nearly as good as actual 4K. You will notice the difference. We streamed a few older shows from HULU like Cheers and Seinfeld and they looked great as well. Again, the picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!**** HDR UPDATE ***I want to thank everyone for their comments about my negative thoughts on HDR. It forced me to do some research on the internet to figure out why HDR looked to terrible on this set. After trial and error, I finally figured it out. You see, I have a home theater system. I bought an ONKYO Receiver a few years back that was 4K compatible. I did not, however, take into consideration that it might not be HDR compatible. (It's not.) So, I was running the 4K player through an HDMI cable into the receiver first, and then into the 4K TV. Which means, no HDR content was reaching the TV. So, as one commenter pointed out, I was turning HDR on when no HDR was available, which results in my original comments below, the picture is dark and the colors look cartoonish.I WAS WRONG!! And I'm glad I was wrong. Nobody likes eating crow, but I am happy to do it after I saw HDR for the first time last night. It is awesome! The colors look amazing, the blacks are really dark, and the whites are really white. My wife and I watched Coral Reef Adventure under the Prime UHD selection from the Amazon app directly on the TV. HDR turned on automatically (as a commenter mentioned it should), and WOW!! It looked spectacular.If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing a bad picture when turning HDR on, they must first realize that not all 4K content is presented with HDR. But what really fixed my situation is this: Run the HDMI directly from the 4K Player to the HDMI \"1\" slot in the back of the TV. That's all it took to make HDR a reality, the way it was intended.I'm keeping the original comments in the review in the hopes of helping anyone else who experiences this issue. Thank you again for the comments about how HDR should work. You guys are the best!***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL COMMENTS*HDR is terrible. This is not the fault of the set, but I want to talk about it here because it\u2019s not worth turning on. If it works for you because of bright lighting in the room or whatever, go for it. But for my wife and I, HDR is not needed. Basically, it\u2019s an artificial layer added to the original picture source to \u201cenhance\u201d things. After several days of tweaking with the settings, trying multiple HDR enabled discs, etc., the picture only got worse with HDR turned on. All it seems to do is make every scene darker, a LOT darker. The HDR effect on colors can be weird. There is a slight red push over flesh tones, and sometimes the colors appear cartoonish, like they were drawn in with crayons. It\u2019s gimmicky, at best. So, if you\u2019re new to 4K, and you\u2019re worried that this set won\u2019t support Dolby Vision, don\u2019t worry too much about it. The 4K picture alone is beautiful you won\u2019t be disappointed with the picture as it is.Also, on the subject of HDR: There are three options, ON, OFF, and AUTO. The only time HDR will turn on is when the HDR setting is switched specifically to ON. If set to AUTO, it might as well be set to OFF because it will never turn on automatically.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************PROS:The picture is beautiful! It is a vast improvement over the regular HD picture from our older TV (which looked great as far as 1080P goes). There are many settings to tweak the set to your liking, and the LIVE FOOTBALL mode is perfect for games. When you watch 4K content, you can get up right next to the screen and see amazing details in the background. You probably don\u2019t want to watch a movie right up close to the screen, but sometimes it\u2019s fun to check out the details of things in the distance.My wife and I have watched Blu-Ray movies and UHD 4K movies from discs as well as streaming 4K content (using the separate 4K player), and they all look great. Regular DVD\u2019s leave a little to be desired, but I knew that going in, so it\u2019s not much of a surprise. What sells this set is the picture! And let\u2019s be honest, this is what you\u2019re looking for in a 75\u201d 4K UHD set. It is spectacular for HD and 4K content! Spectacular!Games and Apps: I play Uncharted 4 on a regular PS4 (not the pro) and the details in color are phenomenal. WOW!! I can\u2019t imagine the game looking any better on a PS4 Pro, but I\u2019d have to do a side by side comparison to really tell the difference.*A NOTE ON SCREEN MIRRORING: If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, it probably will not connect to the TV. The phone will locate the set, but won't connect. SOLUTION: Use Chromecast or (once again) the\u00a0Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)", "The picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!"], ["5.0", "Inky black OLED like experience at a fraction of the cost!", "I was bent on getting a 75 inch TV and I really wanted to get OLED; that left the LG TV with a $20,000 price tag. So, next, I was bent on getting a Samsung because I like the brightness of their screens. Samsung is charging $6000 for their 65\" QLED technology which is barely the next generation of technology. Looking at the Rtings website reviews for best 75 inch TVs, they mentioned that the best mid range 75 inch TV was this Sony 75\" X900E. I did the research. It is not OLED in terms of measurable quantities (it is very good) but I will tell you that the actual viewing experience is 99% of what it is with an OLED TV. The blacks are inky wet black and the the brights are amazing. I can watch this TV outside and it looks great. It very bright. The aesthetics are beautiful. It has a very small bezel, a the glass front has the same allure as fine crystal. It has plenty of adjustments for those who like to tweak and I think it looks great with the settings out of the box. The picture quality, is just amazing and again I can't stress enough how beautiful the HDR (High Dynamic Range) is. Deep rich blacks, plenty of mid tones and excellent highlights. For the price difference I would buy this TV every time and not really miss any real perceivable differences in OLED.  Sony deserves a huge compliment for creating such a beautiful TV and picture as such a great price. I got mine for approximately $3200 and that is great at this point in time.If you are looking for a beautiful TV and picture, especially one in the 75 inch class, mid range and reasonable pricing then this is your TV!"], ["Picture quality is wonderful and the TV was super easy to set-up.  I was disappointed that the TV didn't have component audio out.....I didn't think to check before purchasing. Also, there have been a few times when the TV would not switch from the Google OS to TV...a restart was needed. After a software update that hasn't been happening as often.  Overall, pretty happy with the TV and would purchase again.", "4.0", "Great TV"]], "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MZF81NS/ref=psdc_6459737011_t1_B06X9VSZYM", "description_text": ["Enjoy 4K HDR entertainment on our X900E with Android TV.
